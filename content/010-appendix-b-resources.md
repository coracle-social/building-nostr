## NIP Repositories

As discussed in chapter 5, many Nostr developers have opted to self-publish specifications for protocol extensions. Below is a list of alternative NIP repositories which may contradict or supplement the original repository hosted on github at https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips.

- [NIP PRs](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/pulls) are proposals to the NIPs repository that have not yet been merged, and may be anywhere from a bare idea to partial adoption.
- [NostrHub](https://nostrhub.io/) allows users to publish custom NIPs on nostr using [`kind 30817`](https://nostrhub.io/naddr1qvzqqqrcvypzqprpljlvcnpnw3pejvkkhrc3y6wvmd7vjuad0fg2ud3dky66gaxaqqxku6tswvkk7m3ddehhxarjqk4nmy).
- [DIPs](https://github.com/damus-io/dips) - "Damus Improvement Proposals".
- [NKBIPs](https://github.com/limina1/NKBIPs) - "Nostr Knowledge Base Implementation Possibilities"
- [Custom NIPs for 0xChat](https://github.com/0xchat-app/0xchat-core/tree/d0a6c3f33772fd497a1c7277d5c09821deecf9f6?tab=readme-ov-file#nips-for-0xchat)
- [BUDs](https://github.com/hzrd149/blossom/tree/master) - "Blossom Upgrade Documents".
- [Nostr Event Register](https://wikifreedia.xyz/nip-event-register/liminal@gitcitadel.com) - a register of all of the Nostr event kinds documented in a repository, a note, or on any other publicly-accessible location. (may be out of date)

Also see [this discussion](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/pull/1214) about third-party NIPs. If any sources of specs are missing from this document, please contact me so I can add them.

## Protocol development

Many protocol features exist in the wild without documentation. Below are some resources that can help with designing or discussing protocol features.

- [NostrBook](https://nostrbook.dev/) summarizes protocol details, including NIPs and kinds
- [NostrHub](https://nostrhub.io/apps) surfaces custom NIPs including comment sections and forking.
- [Undocumented Nostr Kinds](https://undocumented.nostrkinds.info/) - a registry of nostr event kinds found in the wild without known documentation.

## App lists

There are hundreds of nostr apps - so many that it would be a full time job to track and categorize them. Many are defunct, or incomplete. See below for different resources for finding high-quality Nostr applications.

- [nostrapp.link](https://nostrapp.link/) - a decentralized directory of nostr applications, built on NIP 89.
- [NostrHub](https://nostrhub.io/apps) lists nostr applications, as well repositories hosted on nostr and DVMs. Built on NIP 89, NIP 34, and NIP 90.
- [Noogle](https://noogle.lol/) allows for browsing and making requests against certain kinds of DVMs. Built on NIP 90.
- [nostrapps.com](https://nostrapps.com/) - a curated list of high-quality nostr apps.
- [Coracle Stuff](https://stuff.coracle.social/) - a curated list of nostr apps created by Coracle.
- [Fiatjaf's Stuff](https://stuff.fiatjaf.com/) - a curated list of nostr apps created by fiatjaf.
