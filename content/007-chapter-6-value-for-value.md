# Chapter 6: Value for Value

The native currency of the internet is not a form of money, but attention.

Sure, there are plenty of places where money is paid for goods or services on the internet. But in large part, these payments are made not between users (who have very little money), but between businesses who have a lot of it, as well as the incentive to leverage that capital for increased revenue or market share growth.

The main drivers of trade on the internet are businesses: companies with a product they wish to sell, and platforms that capture user attention and data in order to sell it to advertisers or data brokers.

When regular people like you and me pay for something on the internet, it's very rarely an isolated occurrence - there are almost always complex systems operating behind the scenes which are intended to leverage that transaction in strategic ways.

If you buy a product on Amazon, they upsell you their subscription offering. And once you have a subscription, you have a sunk cost that encourages you to buy more. When you go to buy something, other product recommendations are offered to you, which are often paid for by the companies attempting to sell the product. Once you've bought something, Amazon asks you to leave a review to encourage others to buy. Every transaction is intended to lead to subsequent transactions.

Amazon wants as many transactions as possible to be processed through their platform, not because they delight in brokering connections between buyers and sellers, but because they love to extract their cut from every transaction.

The same is true in a digital goods context, for example, on streaming services. Sure, you can pay for a subscription, but it doesn't mean the platform won't show you ads. And even if you choose to upgrade to the ad-free "premium" offering, you're still caught in a system optimized not to satsify you and let you go, but for the progressive capture of your attention - whether to reduce churn, grow by network effect, or increase stock prices.

We pay for access to the internet with our time and attention, and we do it on their terms, not our own.

## Money is Time

In his talk entitled "You Wouldn't Zap a Car Crash," Gigi points out this quirk of language: that we *pay* attention and *spend* time. Money is a proxy for the time we have spent accumulating it. But on the internet, that relationship has been reversed. Our time has become a proxy for the money that platforms wish to accumulate.

This is a very clever trick because there are two different ways to view time. Before clocks, time was inhabited either for the purpose of performing work or enjoying leisure, but the two things often coincided. Later, clocks, by allowing us to quantify time spent on a given task, partitioned our time into time with a monetary value (work) and time without monetary value (leisure).

As a result, both work and leisure have been devalued. At work, we're tempted to punch the clock, failing to make the most of our time on the job. At the same time, we often fail to be sufficiently jealous of our leisure time because it has no nominal "value". Instead of working to enrich ourselves during our leisure time (whether by doing a hobby, going on a date, or enjoying nature), we fall into the trap of inertia set for us by a consumer culture.

That's not to say that media and products have no cultural or personal value, but to the extent that the outsourcing of our activity leads to the monetization of our time and attention, our leisure is converted into work - quantified, measured, and captialized on by a third party who wishes to monetize it in some way.

The time that we spend scrolling, browsing, binge watching, and swiping is time that we feel to be well spent in relaxation, "self-care", or entertainment. But in reality, because these media are designed to be addictive, we spend far more time engaging with them than is healthy. This over-consumption in turn tends to *deprive* us of rest, making us more anxious, distracted, and unproductive.

The simple solution to this predicament is simply to "touch grass". Choosing to opt out is a powerful way to re-assert control over our own time. But the perversion of our digital environment does not obviate its benefits. While many of the things the internet offers are intended to appeal to our baser impulses and vices, the original vision of the internet - a desire for information, for freedom, and for community - can be recovered by reforming the medium.

In his talk, Gigi posits a world in which the content that is most readily monetized is not the content that appeals to our baser instincts, but to our conscious, intentional allocation of stored value - in the form of actual money. This restores the role of money as a proxy for our time, as it should be.

He uses the evocative phrase "you wouldn't zap a car crash" to illustrate this. You might watch a car crash against your own will, or against your better judgment. But sending your hard-earned money to the person who distracted you from whatever you were doing would require an irrational, un-self-interested decision.

If the internet were powered by microtransactions rather than attention parasitism, only the content that its inhabitants genuinely appreciate, find helpful, enjoyable, interesting, or useful would accumulate value to itself.

Nostr makes this vision possible, at least on a technical level, through Bitcoin micropayments encoded into Nostr events known as "zaps".

## Customers, Patrons, and Participants

The idea of "value-for-value" has been around for quite a while, particularly in the podcasting 2.0 space, where listeners can stream satoshis to the podcast they're listening to in order to show appreciation for the content they're consuming. The idea is that because the payment is voluntary, it demonstrates that people are willing to compensate producers based on value received. But this is an inadequate understanding of what is actually going with this model.

In trade, the buyer sends a payment and in return the seller releases the content to them. We see this model at work in a content creation context with Patreon, members-only Twitch streams, Substacks, etc. Trade works really well because it aligns with how value is exchanged. Value is subjective, and price is determined by the balance between supply and demand.

However, as Gigi notes in "Purple Text, Orange Highlights" (quoting Eric Hughes), information wants to be free. While digital content does have a fixed cost of production, it has an extremely low marginal cost. This means that the supply of new content is limited, but the supply of existing content is infinite. For digital content, price is determined by purchasers' expectation of future production of content, not contention over existing units. Price can be inflated by introducing artificial scarcity through copyright and access-controlled publishing, but this is only a trick which allows the producer to have an asymmetric privilege in the transaction - while most content producers make very little money, some strike it rich simply by replicating the same content and selling it many times.

For this reason, monetizing digital content through conventional trade is essentially incongruous. In this sense, value-for-value's reversal of the transaction makes sense - supporters are directly incentivising the content producer to continue creating new content. This dynamic is explicitly embraced in crowdfunding, in which consumers pledge in advance a certain amount of money for the development of a product.

Because of this dynamic, value-for-value has more in common with patronage than with trade. Just as Julius II sponsored Michealangelo's work on the Sistine Chapel, your $5/mo donation to your favorite podcast encourages the continuation of the project.

Patronage is not without its ulterior motives, however. Apart from purely altruistic motives, patronage is almost always a means for the patron to increase their influence to some other end, whether political, religious, propagandistic, or egoistic. Patronage is, in essence, a public relations tool. In return for promoting art and culture, patrons get to shape society according to their ideals.

Crowd-sourced patronage doesn't have this same dynamic, because of the relative insignificance of any individual contibutor. But patrons still need to get something out of the relationship - people aren't naturally inclined to give away something for nothing, or to voluntarily shoulder their share of responsibility in maintaining a commons.

The thing that supporters of content creators primarily receive in exchange for their money is a sense of identity or belonging. By giving money to a content creator (or, more broadly, any "cause"), patrons receive a number of social benefits. In this way, distributed patronage is not so different from its more traditional form; in both cases patronage is a form of self-promotion.

Plus, by donating, patrons get to signal their virtue, ironically, as someone who gives without expecting compensation. This in-group signaling (or, less cynically, community building) is frequently more valuable than the project itself.

By contributing to a project, patrons are also assigning themselves a role in its creation, and may gain certain attendant privileges. Examples include the opportunity to participate in the direction of the project by voting, or even to contribute content in the form of fan art or interviews.

In value-for-value podcasting, it's common for boosts to include a message which the content creator then reads during the show. This allows the sender to borrow a little bit of the platform, maybe for marketing purposes, or simply to have their voice heard.

This can be a very healthy dynamic, not to mention pretty fun.

Not only is it nice to see yourself on a leaderboard and try to out-zap other people, but the very act of crowd-funding is itself a unique communication medium full of idiosyncrasies and inside jokes that members of the community can enjoy, and which further galvanize group identity.

This type of content-centric community building can have other second-order benefits, including the development of relationships and a shared set of values.

In most cases, however, this only really works at a small scale. The social benefits that attend community involvement can only scale so far. Once the space that exists within a community is saturated, members' voices become more noise than signal. The time and energy required to actively participate in a given community is also a limit on community growth; community members will take the time to participate to the extent that they are personally invested in the community.

We see this same limit on scale in the growth patterns of certain types of businesses. A company might create a product which is really to their initial users, who show a high willingness to pay. This can encourage additional investment in the business in order to capture more of the market. But the next cohort - even if acquired - is often far harder to monetize, because early adopters tend to be the kind of people who will pay for a niche product, while subsequent cohorts are less invested.

At the end of the day, it is possible to make a value for value model work - but it's important to understand the dynamics actually in play.

## Zaps and Nutzaps

With all that out of the way, let's get into the nuts and bolts of value-for-value micropayments on Nostr.

While other payment mechanisms (e.g., onchain bitcoin, monero, and even fiat) have been proposed, there are currently two standards for micropayments on Nostr, both built on bitcoin.

The first (and original) is NIP-57 zaps, which allow users to couple the payment of a Lightning invoice (requested from the receiver's wallet) to a Nostr event that gets published by the sender's wallet, creating a public artifact demonstrating that they paid the receiver. The flow is fairly complex, so here's a diagram, borrowed from [nostr.how](https://nostr.how):

![How Zaps Work](https://nostr.how/images/zap-flow.webp)

Zaps support all of the value for value use cases mentioned above and can even be used for paywalled content, since zap receipts are signed by the receiver's wallet key. As long as the receiver trusts their wallet, they can respond to these receipts in any way that they choose.

There are a couple important limitations to zaps. First is that it requires both the sender and the receiver's wallets to be online. This means that wallets either have to be self-hosted, which is a significant hurdle for non-technical users, or they have to be custodial.

All things considered, this isn't a huge deal. For most use cases involving zaps, the amounts sent and received are pretty small. Having a couple hundred dollars in a hot wallet hosted by a third party isn't a huge risk for the user.

However, at scale, a single custodian for many wallets becomes a central point of failure, not only in terms of availability, but also privacy and solvency. The other important flaw is that zap receipts can only be trusted to the extent that the receiver's wallet can be trusted. This means that the wallet can create as many fake zaps as they want by issuing receipts for invoices that weren't actually paid.

In practice, this isn't a fatal flaw, as long as zap analysis isn't sybil resistant. In other words, even if a wallet provider is honest, anyone can create any number of sock puppet accounts and use them to send zaps to their own wallet.

To avoid this problem, implementations might filter zaps by sender based on web of trust, or any other mechanism they choose. This is a minor concern for regular clients, since the worst that can happen in most cases is for a note the user has already fetched to show a higher zap total than it should. But for services that provide a "trending" feed based on zaps, it's very important to only rely on zaps that are likely to be authentic. This attack has been implemented a handful of times for demonstration purposes, but most clients don't bother to provide sybil protection yet.

Next up we have NIP 61 "nutzaps", which are an entirely separate standard powered by pubkey-locked Cashu tokens (hence the pun).

In contrast to NIP 57 zaps, nut zaps can be sent, received, and validated offline as long as the receiver's `kind 17375` wallet event (defined by NIP 60) is already available. This makes nut zaps much faster because they're non-interactive.

Because the Cashu tokens are locked to the receiver's pubkey, the receiver can immediately verify that the eCash has not been double spent. This solves the problem of untrustworthy receiver wallets, but it doesn't provide sybil resistance.

Nut zaps have an additional vulnerability in that all value in the form of eCash tokens is custodied by the eCash mint. These mints are the ones that provide the proof that a token has been locked to a given pubkey. But if the mint is not trustworthy, it can allow double spends, or even withdraw the bitcoin backing the tokens from the mint entirely.

Both eCash and custodial lightning payments are vulnerable to custodians in a similar way. In both cases, the reputation of a given wallet or mint is largely predicated on how well the service is run in terms of availability, and performance, or operator reputation. The difference between the two is that because of money transmitter laws, mint operators tend to prefer anonymity, while custodial lightning wallets are usually more easily identifiable. The result is that mints generally will have a lower trust profile.

In either case though, operators can choose to steal all the money backing their service at any time. This attack completely burns the service provider's reputation (and would likely result in prison time if the operator can be identified), but it also can't be anticipated.

Distributing user funds across multiple mints does protect the user to some extent because if a mint operator rugs, users will lose only part of their balance. Nostr relay redundancy works because information can be freely copied, but money doesn't work the same way. Reducing the risk to an individual user doesn't solve the malincentive that mint operators have to build up their reputation over the course of years and finally steal all the money when they reach critical mass.

Both forms of zaps have their use cases, with significant trade-offs involving custodian trustworthiness. In general, NIP 57 zaps are probably a better solution for most users since wallet providers are going to be more accountable to users at scale. However, if eCash mints can be selected based on existing trust relationships (the "uncle jim" model), NIP 61 nutzaps can become a viable alternative for those users, bringing with it a superior user experience.
