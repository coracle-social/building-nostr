# Introduction: Nostr is for Builders

Nostr stands for "Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays." It was created as an answer to social media censorship by big tech companies, but has since become much more. Chances are, if you're reading this book you're already interested in Nostr development. Maybe it's the cryptographic identity that hooked you, or the network effect that application interoperability makes possible. Maybe it's the social media use cases, or the "other stuff" that brings you here.

Nostr is many things to many people — the architecture is simple, but a diverse application ecosystem has grown from it.

Nostr is an open protocol, which means anyone can build on it and anyone can extend it. It relies on digital signatures for data authentication and self-hosted or otherwise user-aligned infrastructure for hosting.

The simplest way to think about it is as a Twitter alternative, but one where it's very difficult for any single actor to de-platform users. But Nostr is far broader than just "social media". Other applications from media hosting to decentralized marketplaces, reviews, chat rooms, calendar events, and even virtual pets have found ways to leverage Nostr in their own domain.

This book is for builders — for people who are excited about decentralization and have ideas for a product or service that would benefit from interoperability and user-oriented software. This book presents a philosophical overview of Nostr with an emphasis on *the responsibility developers have to keep it decentralized*.

This book will cover some of the basics in passing, but primarily as a stepping stone to explaining a paradigm for how to use the protocol effectively. For a more technical overview of the protocol itself, take a look at [NostrBook](https://nostrbook.dev/).

Like Nostr itself, this book is not a comprehensive guide for how Nostr works (or ought to work). It is only a set of opinions, ideas, and guidelines for people who wish to create software for themselves or others — software that enriches its users rather than exploiting them.
