Nostr stands for notes and other stuff transmitted over relays. It was created as an answer to internet censorship by big tech companies, but has since become much more. Over time, notes have become less consequential and the other stuff more important.

Nostra is an open protocol, means anyone can build on it and anyone can extend it.

users generate and hold a public-private key pair which constitutes their cryptographic identity.

They then use this key pair to create digital signatures of content.

which is embedded in data structures called events.

Every event has a kind, and that kind determines how that event ought to be interpreted. For example, a kind three is a list of people that you follow on social media.

Jon (05:08.942)
A Kind 30023 is a blog post. A Kind 9 is a chat message. And so on.

Jon (05:20.884)
Users can also use their key pairs to encrypt or decrypt data, either to themselves or to other people on the protocol.

These events are then transmitted to other people, primarily via relay.

A relay is a, primarily via relay, although they can also be sent by Bluetooth, emailed as an attachment.

Jon (06:10.092)
which speak protocol for sending, receiving, rejecting, requesting, responding with events.

Jon (06:32.108)
The relay protocol is extremely simple to make it easy to create multiple implementations that can talk to each other.

Likewise, the protocol is very loosely coupled.

allowing many client applications to be built which can talk to each other. Not every client needs to implement the entire protocol.

Jon (07:10.798)
In fact,

Jon (07:19.372)
That would likely be a mistake.

Nostra is optimized for smaller apps that do one thing well that don't have switching costs. You might sign in to your Twitter-like account with one with your cryptographic identity and easily and follow a link to a video sharing.

website which allows you to log in with the same identity. You can then bookmark those pages. The bookmarks are saved, encrypted, and saved according to settings stored on Noster.

Jon (08:18.734)
In a lot of ways, Nostra has the ability to upgrade the entire internet. That's a big claim, and there are definitely some things that Nostra can't do well on its own. But it also has adapters that allow third-party services to do the kind of computation that Nostra is bad at.

In terms of the CAP theorem.

Jon (08:56.268)
Noster has no consistency, but plenty of atomicity and partition tolerance. Noster is a database. It's a distributed database because the network has many nodes which can go offline at any time. And so Noster relies on every node.

Jon (00:02.126)
Okay, so that's a quick sketch of what this...

I mentioned earlier that Noster is censorship resistant. Censorship resistance is a core goal of Noster because Noster is in many ways a reaction against the deficiencies of the internet as

Jon (05:34.574)
The ISEE software is an entirely different story. If your users are only there to improve their quality of life through access to entertainment or communication products, but the marginal cost of production trends towards zero for those things, the price is also going to trend to zero because other people can always offer the same product at a lower price.

So we see large network-based internet businesses rise and fall.

Jon (09:06.222)
And yet the art of creating this moat seems to have been perfected. Facebook has been around for a long time. So has Google. These second generation internet companies have learned how to exercise the power of

their users because they have learned how to effectively monetize their users. They don't monetize users by charging directly for their product. I mean, how valuable is Google anyway nowadays with alternatives like DuckDuckGo, Brave, or Kagi on the market? Instead,

These big tech companies monetize their users by...

Jon (09:56.8)
selling them. Users have two things that platform owners can sell. Their attention and their data. And platforms can only sell these things because they have access to them by virtue of being intermediaries. Platforms subsist by inserting themselves into private or public relationships in order to siphon off

these intangible goods of attention and data.

And it works great because individuals don't believe that their attention or data are worth anything. a billboard in your peripheral vision is hardly comparable to having to pay $5 a month for the use of a road. Likewise, having cameras that record your license plate on a highway are well worth not having to pay.

And indeed, these things are not that valuable on an individual basis. But they're massively powerful in the aggregate. Because through data science...

Jon (11:26.446)
The data that is collected can be used to infer all kinds of things about people's behavior, which can be used at scale to manipulate people to...

think one thing or another, to purchase one thing or another, or to act one way or another. All of this goes to amplifying the more straightforward business model of advertising. Advertising is not just about

taking, displacing some content with an advertisement. It's about engineering the human mind and conditioning it such that it is prepared to act in a predictable

And so in a real sense, the cost of giving away our attention and data to these internet intermediaries is the loss of our free will.

Jon (15:29.14)

And it is only through people that any of these problems can be solved. Noster is a way not of creating a system that will solve all the problems, but of allowing individual agency to be exercised to solve problems. In other words, Noster trusts the user.

Jon (00:01.73)
Just like Noster, this book is not a framework or a comprehensive guide for how Noster works or ought to work. It is only a set of ideas and guidelines for people who wish to create software for themselves or others.

that benefits rather than hurting.
